                    <p class = "text-left"> The application will allow the nursing staff users to request specific shift times and
                        days, request holidays, swap shifts between staff (in the same department where
                        they have the same job title) and visualize their timetable allocated for the whole
                        month at once.</p></br>
                    <p class = "text-left"> Every Charge nurse user on the department will have all the privileges as the nursing
                        staff, and additionally, they will have the ability to accept requests for a specific shift
                        or holiday day sent by the rest of the staff. Charge nurses will also be able to view the
                        staff name, job title and shift time for each specific day of the month.</p></br>
